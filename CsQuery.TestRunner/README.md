## CsQuery Test Runner - What Is This?

6/25/2012

This is a wrapper for the performance tests so I can use profiling tools. It is extremely crude and has nothing to do with the test suite. Probably best you ignore it. 

The actual test suite can be run in **both Visual Studio and NUnit test runners**; you don't need this.
