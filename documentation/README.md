#####CsQuery Documentation

We're still a bit behind on that "web site" thing which will contain all kinds of amazing features and organized API documentation.

For now I am going to try to document important features here; these files will sort the web site for content that goes beyond the API/auto-generated XML documentation.

*Note: these links will not work if you are reading this from the GitHub landing page. Click "readme.md" above first. There's no way to make them work from the readme preview and the readme file itself.*
