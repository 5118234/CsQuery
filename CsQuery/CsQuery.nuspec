    <description>CsQuery is C# jQuery port for .NET 4. It implements all CSS2 and CSS3 selectors, all the DOM manipulation methods of jQuery, and some of the utility methods. It includes a document object model that mimics the browser DOM, and uses a subselect-capable index for very fast operation.</description>
    <releaseNotes>Version 1.1 is feature-complete and implements all CSS3 selectors that were missing from 1.0.

Version 1.1.1 is a bugfix release.  The tests from Sizzle were migrated and revealed a few problems. This release corrects all known CSS selector bugs.
