### Change Log

####Version 1.1.3.1

Released 2012.07.19 *Bugfix Release*

- [Issue #20](https://github.com/jamietre/CsQuery/issues/20) - selector engine doesn't recognize hex escape sequences - [pull request #22 from @vitallium](https://github.com/jamietre/CsQuery/pull/22)

https://github.com/jamietre/CsQuery/pull/22


####Version 1.1.3

Released 2012.07.17. See [release notes for version 1.1.3](http://blog.outsharked.com/2012/07/csquery-113-released.html)

*Features*

- [Pull Request #17:](https://github.com/jamietre/CsQuery/pull/17) API to add custom filter selectors
- Added `CsQuery.Config` static class for default configuration. Static configuration properties on the `CQ` object refer to this now and will be deprecated in the future.

*Bug Fixes*

- [Issue #18](https://github.com/jamietre/CsQuery/issues/18) - class & style not being indexed as an attribute
- "IDomObject.Classes" breaking when no classes returned (no bug report)

*Other changes*

- Refactored most pseudoclass selectors into modules using new API
- Some performance improvements to selection engine achieved by "lazy-sorting" selection set results and better caching of root Document node

####Version 1.1.2.2

- [Issue #16](https://github.com/jamietre/CsQuery/issues/16) causing HTML to parse incorrectly where the tag name and the first attribute were separated by new lines
- [Issue #15](https://github.com/jamietre/CsQuery/issues/15) crashing when using ":hidden" pseudoselector on an input element with no "type" attribute
- Fix for return values of `InsertAfter(sequence)` and `InsertBefore(sequence)`; was returning the original object, should have been returning the elements that were inserted. No issue for this bug, discovered during testing.
- Added `EachUntil` methods to implement the jQuery "each" method's functionality where a "false" return value causes the looping to end
- Added complete XML documentation for most common objects and interfaces: CQ, IDomDocument, IDomElement, IDomObject, some others, including links to related documentation from jQuery and Mozilla.
- Reorganization of CQ object properties and methods into more files to make it easier to work with


####Version 1.1.2.1

- Added XML docs to NuGet distribution.
- [Issue #13](https://github.com/jamietre/CsQuery/pull/13) Fix `Data` method to conform with jQuery tests (failed a few tests)
- [Issue #14](https://github.com/jamietre/CsQuery/issues/14) `Slice` method bug

####Version 1.1.2

See [release notes for version 1.1.2](http://blog.outsharked.com/2012/06/csquery-112-released.html)

*Features*

- Updates to the HTML parser to conform with HTML5 optional opening & closing tag rules. This greatly improves compatibility between the final HTML generated by CsQuery, and the DOM produced by web browsers. 

*Bug Fixes*

* [Issue #12](https://github.com/jamietre/CsQuery/issues/12) CSS class names being output in lowercase
* [Issue #11](https://github.com/jamietre/CsQuery/issues/11) :hidden selector not selecting input[type=hidden]
* [Issue #8](https://github.com/jamietre/CsQuery/issues/8) allow leading + and - signs in nth-child type equations
* Corrected a problem with some last-child selectors (found during Sizzle unit test migration, no bug report)

####Version 1.1.1

All tests from jQuery Sizzle project have been migrated; some bugs in complex selectors were revealed during this exercise. All known bugs have been fixed and all tests pass with one exception: leading operators (+ and -) are not allowed in formula CSS selectors. For example, `:nth-child(+2n+1)` will fail, but `:nth-child(2n+1)` will work. This is legal CSS but also a low priority as it is an edge case.

This release added the `:input` jQuery pseudoclass selector which I had overlooked before. The CSS engine was refactored a bit and should perform better too.

####Version 1.1.0

First NuGet release. See [release notes for version 1.1](http://blog.outsharked.com/2012/06/csquery-11-released-and-available-on.html)
